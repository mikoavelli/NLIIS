Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTION
Heart development is a highly orchestrated process dependent on dynamic interactions between the myocardium and the endocardium. The two layers are separated by a noncellular matrix called cardiac jelly and communicate through signaling pathways involving membrane-bound receptors and ligands. However, the mechanisms enabling such signaling interaction over physical distances remain poorly understood. In this work, we characterized tunneling nanotubeâ€“like structures (TNTLs), which we found physically connecting cardiomyocytes (CMs) in the myocardium to endocardial cells (ECs) in the endocardium. These structures likely help to facilitate long-distance intercellular communication essential for heart formation.
RATIONALE
Heart formation relies on precise signaling interactions between the myocardium and endocardium, particularly during trabecular development. Signaling pathways, such as Notch, Vegf, and Nrg, have ligands and receptors segregated across these two cardiac layers. The mechanisms enabling these long-distance interactions across the intervening cardiac jelly are unclear. We hypothesized that TNTL structures exist between the cardiac layers and could mediate intercellular long-distance communication in the developing heart, allowing for the transport of signaling molecules and cytoplasmic proteins between them.
RESULTS
We used genetic labeling, contact-tracing techniques, and advanced imaging to demonstrate the existence of TNTLs in mouse embryonic hearts. These TNTLs extended from CMs to ECs across the cardiac jelly, establishing direct connections that enable signal transduction and cytoplasmic protein transfer.
The TNTLs were identified in the heart through the genetic labeling of cellular protrusions. During mouse development TNTLs were shown to form between CMs and ECs as early as embryonic day. The filamentous structures inside TNTL were characterized by three-dimensional imaging and the reconstruction of the electron microscopy (EM) and cryo-EM images.
The TNTLs contained actin filaments, and TNTL formation depended on actin polymerization. The presence of actin filaments in TNTLs was confirmed in a transgenic mouse line that could label actin filaments with a fluorescent marker. Inhibiting actin polymerization chemically or by ablating the small guanosine triphosphatase, Cdc, eliminated TNTLs.
The TNTLs were involved in regulating Notch signaling and other signaling pathways. TNTLs were sufficient to activate Notch signaling in ECs, with ligands from CMs transported through these microstructures to ECs. Loss of TNTLs resulted in reduced Notch signaling and other signaling pathways. TNTLs were able to transport signaling molecules, cytoplasmic proteins, and trafficking vesicles, underscoring their role as conduits for intercellular communication.
The TNTLs were essential in cardiac morphogenesis. Disruption of TNTLs in embryonic hearts resulted in impaired ventricular wall morphogenesis, evidenced by loss of trabeculae and defective myocardial growth.
CONCLUSION
In this work, we identified TNTLs as a critical mechanism for long-distance intercellular communication during heart development.
These actin-rich structures physically bridge the myocardium and endocardium, allowing for the efficient exchange of signaling molecules necessary for trabecular formation and ventricular wall morphogenesis. Disruption of TNTLs compromises these interactions, highlighting their essential role in heart patterning. This work provides insights into mechanisms of cellular communication and suggests that TNTL formation might help cells to regulate long-distance cell-cell communication and modulate tissue patterning in mammalian systems. Future research should explore the molecular machinery governing TNTL formation, the structural basis of the interface between TNTLs and endocardial cells (see summary figure), the molecular mechanism of protein trafficking inside the TNTL, the potential functions of cytoplasmic protein transfer between myocardium and endocardium during heart formation, and the potential therapeutic implications of modulating these structures in congenital heart defects and heart failure.
The digital realm unfolds before us, a boundless expanse of interconnected nodes, each pulsing with the potential for creation and destruction. We are the architects of this new reality, wielding algorithms and code as our tools, shaping the very fabric of existence in ways that were once relegated to the realm of science fiction. But with this power comes responsibility, a burden that we must bear with careful consideration and unwavering ethical commitment.

Consider the implications of artificial intelligence, a force that is rapidly transforming every aspect of our lives. From self-driving cars to personalized medicine, AI promises to solve some of humanity's most pressing challenges. Yet, the potential for misuse is undeniable. Algorithmic bias, job displacement, and the erosion of privacy are just a few of the concerns that we must address proactively.

The quest for knowledge is an inherent human drive, a thirst that propels us to explore the uncharted territories of science, philosophy, and art. We seek to understand the fundamental principles that govern the universe, to unravel the mysteries of consciousness, and to express the beauty and complexity of the human experience. But this pursuit is not without its obstacles. The limitations of our own perception, the biases of our cultural conditioning, and the ever-present threat of misinformation can all distort our understanding of the truth.

Nature, in its raw and untamed glory, remains a constant source of inspiration and wonder. The soaring peaks of mountains, the vast expanse of the ocean, and the intricate details of a single flower all speak to the profound beauty and interconnectedness of life. We are but a small part of this grand tapestry, and it is our duty to protect and preserve the natural world for future generations.

The ephemeral nature of time weighs heavily on the human spirit. We are born, we live, and we die, leaving behind only memories and legacies. The awareness of our own mortality can be both terrifying and liberating. It forces us to confront our priorities, to cherish the present moment, and to strive to make a meaningful contribution to the world.

The mundane details of daily life often obscure the deeper truths that lie beneath the surface. A simple cup of coffee, a fleeting conversation with a stranger, or the gentle rustling of leaves in the wind can all offer profound insights if we take the time to truly observe and reflect. It is in these small moments that we often find the greatest meaning.

The search for meaning is a universal human endeavor. We seek to understand our place in the cosmos, to define our purpose, and to create a life that is both fulfilling and meaningful. This journey is often fraught with challenges and setbacks, but it is through these struggles that we ultimately grow and evolve.

Technology, while a powerful tool, is not a panacea for all of humanity's ills. It can amplify our strengths and our weaknesses, but it cannot replace the fundamental human qualities of empathy, compassion, and critical thinking. We must use technology wisely and ethically, ensuring that it serves the common good and promotes a more just and equitable world.

The exploration of space represents the ultimate frontier, a challenge that pushes the boundaries of human ingenuity and determination. The search for extraterrestrial life, the colonization of other planets, and the unraveling of the mysteries of the universe all hold the potential to transform our understanding of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.

The power of storytelling is undeniable. Stories shape our beliefs, influence our actions, and connect us to one another. They allow us to experience different perspectives, to empathize with others, and to learn from the mistakes of the past.

The role of government is to serve the people, to protect their rights, and to promote the common good. But government is also susceptible to corruption, inefficiency, and abuse of power. It is our responsibility as citizens to hold our elected officials accountable and to ensure that government serves its intended purpose.

The impact of climate change is becoming increasingly apparent. Rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and the loss of biodiversity are just a few of the consequences that we are already experiencing. We must take urgent action to reduce our carbon emissions and to mitigate the effects of climate change before it is too late.

The issue of social justice is a persistent challenge in our society. Inequality, discrimination, and prejudice continue to plague our communities, preventing many people from reaching their full potential. We must strive to create a more just and equitable world for all.
